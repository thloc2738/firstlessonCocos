For example, if the type is Texture2D, the previous definition is:
    shootSound: cc.Texture2D,
If you use JS, it should be changed to:
    shootSound: {
      type: cc.Texture2D // use 'type:' to define Texture2D object directly
      default: null,     // object's default value is null
    },
If you use TS, it should be changed to:
    %s: {
      type: cc.Texture2D // use 'type:' to define Texture2D object directly
    }
    %s: cc.Texture2D = null;
(This helps us to successfully refactor all RawAssets at v2.0, sorry for the inconvenience. ðŸ˜° )
